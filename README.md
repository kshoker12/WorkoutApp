An app that keeps can be used to design your own workout routine as well as keep track of
current workout. 

A *bulleted* list:
- **What will Application do?**

*This application is intended to allow user to create their own workout routine 
by making exercises which include a name, number of sets, and number of reps. They can also add
exercises to a specific muscle group, and they can access all the exercises that are
included for a muscle group and do various operations on them such as editing, adding, and removing an exercise 
from muscle group. 
Users can create their workout session by adding entire muscle groups to their session
or they can add individual exercises as well. This app also allows them preview their workout by printing out the 
current exercise, allowing 
them to edit their session accordingly if it is too hard or too easy. The main feature of this app is that it 
allows users
to track their workout with a press of a button as it prints out the next exercise in their session when they are 
finished the current exercise. 

- **Who will use it?**

*This app is intended for those that workout and want an app that they can use to 
track their workout and create their own training session. This is very convenient because while people
workout they have a hard time keeping track of which exercises they want to do and how many sets and reps they
got to do. 
This app will allow users to never forget an exercise and will assist them in achieving great results when working out 
and stay consistent.*

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

*This project interests me because I workout, and sometimes struggle to remember and keep track of
my routine and might miss an exercise so having an app that I can use to track and plan my workouts is ideal and makes 
working out a lot more convenient.*
